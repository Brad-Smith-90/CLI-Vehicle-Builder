# ðŸš— CLI Vehicle Builder

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application built with TypeScript for creating and managing different types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and motorbikes. This project showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by allowing users to interact with vehicles, assign attributes, and perform actions like adding and displaying vehicle details.

## Features

- Add various types of vehicles: cars, trucks, and motorbikes.
- Manage vehicle attributes like model, year, and color.
- Display a list of all created vehicles.
- Use a simple CLI interface to interact with the application.
- Written in TypeScript to ensure strong type safety and OOP practices.

## Built With

- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and object-oriented structure.
- **Inquirer.js**: For building a dynamic command-line interface.
- **Node.js**: For running the application on the command line.

## Getting Started

- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **npm** (or yarn)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

```
2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
   cd cli-vehicle-builder
```
4. Install the dependencies:

```bash
   npm install
```
## Usage

1. Run the application:
